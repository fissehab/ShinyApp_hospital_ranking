This is my shiny app that helps to see the performances of various US hospitals in heart attack, heart failure and pneumonia.

We can select a state and outcome and see the best hospitals in the state. Further, we can select a hospital from the drop down menu and see its rank in the state and compare its performance with all hospitals across the nation.
